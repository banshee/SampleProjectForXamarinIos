* Use 4.3.2 (build 2) version of Xamarin Studio (as of 13 Feb 2014).

* Instructions for installing F# binding are here: http://fsharp.org/use/ios/.
The short version: just install from the repo using normal XS tools. 

* Make sure that you have two addins enabled:

  Mobile Development > F# Support for Xamarin.iOS
  Language Binding > F# Language Binding

I've noticed that sometimes the language binding gets disabled when other addins are installed.  Just click the enable button again.

* You need to include FSharp.Core and mscorlib from MonoTouch in the ui.ios project.  If you add them using the GUI, you'll end up 
  with relative paths like this (and note the goofy Windows-style paths with backslashes instead of normal slashes):

    <Reference Include="FSharp.Core">
      <HintPath>..\..\..\..\..\Developer\MonoTouch\usr\lib\mono\2.1\FSharp.Core.dll</HintPath>
    </Reference>
    <Reference Include="mscorlib">
      <HintPath>..\..\..\..\..\Developer\MonoTouch\usr\lib\mono\2.1\mscorlib.dll</HintPath>
    </Reference>

I like to modify them (in a text editor) to be absolute:

    <Reference Include="FSharp.Core">
      <HintPath>\Developer\MonoTouch\usr\lib\mono\2.1\FSharp.Core.dll</HintPath>
    </Reference>
    <Reference Include="mscorlib">
      <HintPath>\Developer\MonoTouch\usr\lib\mono\2.1\mscorlib.dll</HintPath>
    </Reference>
